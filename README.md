# FAs-ImageJ-Macro

Created to speed up analysis of microscopic images of focal adhesions (FAs). Before, the analysis was done by manually measuring each FA, which could take half an hour to measure single image. Using this macro, during the same time it is possible to measure dozens of images with minimal input from the user.


Based on FAs channel calculates length of FAs. Second channel (e.g. F-actin) is used to determine cells surface in order to calculate changes in FAs numbers.
Because TIRF microscopy images are used, at the beggining macro does a series of operations to equalize the signal in the whole images.
