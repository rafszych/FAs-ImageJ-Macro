# FAs-ImageJ-Macro

Created to speed up analysis of microscopic images of focal adhesions (FAs). Based on FAs channel calculates length of FAs. Second channel (e.g. F-actin) is used to determine cells surface in order to calculate changes in FAs numbers.

Because TIRF microscopy images are used, at the beggining macro does a series of operations to equalize the signal in the whole images.

User input is required to set correct threshold in both channel analysis.
